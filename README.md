  # Social Network API
  ## Project Description
  This repository holds the code for a simple social network API. Because the focus of this repo is to demonstrate knowledge and a grasp of the back-end of a possible web application, there is no front-end or deployed app. The interested party would need to incorporate a REST API client such as Insomnia or Postman to test the API routes and simulate client-side server requests. In brief, Node.js is paired with the server framework Express.js to establish API routes and the corresponding HTTP request methods; a NoSQL, MongoDB database is paired with the object-document mapper (ODM) Mongoose for holding the data and defining the schema/models, respectively. A user can create a thought, a reaction to another user's thought, add and remove friends; routes have also been built for getting all users and thoughts, and deleting users and thoughts.

  ## Installation
  After cloning or downloading a local copy of the repository, from a terminal install the required dependencies that are listed in the package.json file:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  Once the node_modules folder is created and all dependencies are downloaded, type the following in your terminal:
  
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  The *start* command effectively stands in for running "node index.js" as shown in the "scripts" property in the package.json file you download.
    
  ## Usage
  This repository's code can be used as a framework for the interested party who wishes to create their own server-side API for some web application that allows for users to posts commentary, responses to other users' commentary, etc.<br>
